# Slack Integration Configuration

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create a Slack App**:
   - Go to https://api.slack.com/apps
   - Click "Create New App" ‚Üí "From scratch"
   - Name: "Youth Soccer Master Index"
   - Choose your workspace

2. **Enable Incoming Webhooks**:
   - Go to "Features" ‚Üí "Incoming Webhooks"
   - Toggle "Activate Incoming Webhooks" to On
   - Click "Add New Webhook to Workspace"
   - Choose the channel where you want notifications
   - Copy the webhook URL

3. **Configure Environment Variable**:
   ```bash
   # Add to your .env file or set as environment variable
   export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
   ```

## Security Notes

- The webhook URL is a one-way key - it only allows sending messages to Slack
- It cannot read data or access your Slack account
- You can revoke it anytime from Slack App Management
- For multiple channels, create one webhook per channel
