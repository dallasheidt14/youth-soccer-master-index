# v53E Ranking Engine Configuration
# This file contains all the parameters for the ranking methodology

# Time window and game limits
WINDOW_DAYS: 365                    # Look back window in days
MAX_GAMES_FOR_RANK: 30              # Maximum games per team for ranking
INACTIVE_HIDE_DAYS: 180             # Days since last game to mark as inactive

# Goal difference capping
GOAL_DIFF_CAP: 6                    # Cap goal difference to Â±6

# Recency weighting
RECENT_K: 10                        # Number of recent games to emphasize
RECENT_SHARE: 0.70                 # Fraction of weight for recent games

# Tail dampening (for games beyond recent_k)
DAMPEN_TAIL_START: 26               # Start index for tail dampening
DAMPEN_TAIL_END: 30                 # End index for tail dampening
DAMPEN_TAIL_START_WEIGHT: 0.8       # Weight at tail start

# Adaptive K-factor
ADAPTIVE_K_ALPHA: 0.5               # Alpha parameter for gap scaling

# Bayesian shrinkage
SHRINK_TAU: 8                      # Shrinkage parameter (higher = more shrinkage)

# Provisional status
PROVISIONAL_ALPHA: 1.5             # Exponent for game count penalty
